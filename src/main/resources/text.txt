In this chapter, we'll apply a minimal Spring Security configuration to start addressing our
first finding—inadvertent privilege escalation due to a lack of   URL protection, and general
authentication from the security audit discussed in Chapter 1 , Anatomy of an Unsafe
Application. We will then build on the basic configuration to provide a customized
experience for our users. This chapter is intended to get you up and running with Spring
Security and to provide a foundation for any other security-related tasks you will need to
perform.

We encourage you to import the chapter02.00-calendar project into your IDE, and
follow along by obtaining the source code from this chapter, as described in the Getting
started with JBCP calendar sample code section in the Appendix , Additional Reference Material.
For each chapter, you will find multiple revisions of the code that represent checkpoints
within the book. This makes it easy to compare your work to the correct answers as you go.
At the beginning of each chapter, we will import the first revision of that chapter as a
starting point. For example, in this chapter, we start with chapter02.00-calendar , and
the first checkpoint will be chapter02.01-calendar . In Chapter 3 , Custom Authentication,
we will start with chapter03.00-calendar , and the first checkpoint will be
chapter03.01-calendar . There are additional details in the Getting started with JBCP
calendar sample code section in the Appendix , Additional Reference Material, so be sure to refer
to it for details.
